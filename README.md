# Find My Movie: An Interactive Front-End Project

Project 1 Group Assignment

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive front-end website using the tools that we have learned thus far:
- Use a CSS framework, such as Bootstrap
- Be interactive (accepts and responds to user input)
- Use at least two server-side APIs
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data
Through the course of this project, we helped strengthen our skills in these areas, but also learned how to work on a team using GitHub.  We learned to use branches, merge, address conflicts, and use the Project board and Isses sections to track our progress.
